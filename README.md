# Swarm Robotics: Optimizing Behavior for Survival in the Presence of Enemies

## Project Overview
**Platform:** [ARGoS Simulation Framework](https://argos-sim.info/)  
**Robotic Platform:** E-puck2  

This project focuses on optimizing swarm robotic behavior in a simulated environment where friendly robots must survive in the presence of adversarial enemy agents. The goal is to develop effective flocking behaviors that balance survival, target-seeking, and enemy avoidance. The project leverages the ARGoS simulation framework and supports large-scale testing with dynamically adjustable parameters.

This work is based on the integration of **Daniel H. Stolfi**'s contributions to integrating the **E-puck2** with ARGoS. However, significant additional integrations and adaptations were necessary to fully implement the survival-based swarm behaviors. My work focused on refining the simulation dynamics, enhancing modularity, and developing a robust parameter tuning and data collection pipeline while ensuring a scalable and adaptive framework. This contribution builds upon prior foundations while introducing new mechanisms for improved efficiency and analysis.

## Key Features
### üèó Dynamic and Modular Architecture
- **Independent Controllers:** Separate controllers for friendly and enemy robots.
- **Loop Functions:** Global simulation management (collision detection, robot removal, data logging).
- **Configurable Parameters:** Adjustable via ARGoS configuration file for seamless experimentation.

### üîÑ Survival-Oriented Optimization
- Robots optimize their movement strategies to avoid enemy collisions while maintaining flocking behavior.
- A **Lennard-Jones potential model** is used for flocking and repulsion forces.
- Adaptive repulsion forces differentiate friend-to-friend interactions from friend-to-enemy interactions.

### üìä Scalability and Automation
- Supports large-scale testing with customizable numbers of friendly and enemy robots.
- Python-based automation pipeline runs thousands of simulations, collects results, and logs data into CSV files.
